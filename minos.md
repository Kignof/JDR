## Herdborn Minos

The idea of the Herdborn is to represent an above-ground nomadic version of Minos; they're still not a common sight, as they tend to stay well clear of civilisation, but may come into contact from time to time, making them a more obvious choice for a player character.

### Alignment: 
Tend towards neutral, lawful if from a self-sufficient tribe, chaotic if from one that may need to raid for supplies.
### Natural Forager: 
Advantage of Survival when foraging.
### Tireless Traveller: 
Advantage on CON saves for forced marching.
###  Trade Language: 
Speaks, reads and writes Common to a rudimentary degree

## Labyrinthine Minos

This is the classic maze-dwelling monster; tend to be loners except in larger areas of the underdark where a group may control shared territory. More vicious and monstrous.

### Alignment: Tend 
towards evil (not above eating someone)
### Darkvision (60ft.): 
Easier to catch prey in your labyrinth if you can actually see.
### Labyrinthine Recall: 
Can perfectly recall any route you have travelled.


Racial feat : 

Choose either one

### Pummelling Horns: 
After making a melee attack with Horns during your turn, as a reaction you can make the target take a Strength saving throw of 6 + your Proficiency + your Strength modifier, on failure they are pushed 10 feet. If used as with a Goring Rush or the Charger feat, the target is also knocked Prone.
### Long Horns: 
Once per turn unarmed strike (headbutt) at 1d6 + STR piercing, 2d6 + STR at level 8, and 3d6 + STR at level 20.
