Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension, disgust and disdain. Born from the dragons of yore themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the attributes of dragons and humanoids yet failing to reach the perfection achieved by the Dragon priestesses. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to the now fading true dragons still upheld by the Dragon priestesses, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your wisdom score increases by 1.

### Age. 
Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

### Alignment. 
Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.

### Breath Weapon. 
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage in an area according to your ancestry. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
