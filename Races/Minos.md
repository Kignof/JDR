Minos are the distant and more civilized cousins of the more feral and primitive Minotaurs, evolving past their mindless hunger for carnage and battles in favor of reconnecting with their human side. They still hold some pride in their feriocious physical prowess and battle superiority, often clashing with Bearfolks and Leonines to prove their Race superiority and seeing them as rivals.
