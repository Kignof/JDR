    Large Creature: Can wield Large weapons (must be looted from suitably nasty creatures or crafted at your DM's discretion). When wielding medium weapons may ignore the Two-Handed property of one weapon, has -5 to attack rolls for Light weapons.

    Feared Reputation: Disadvantage Persuasion with any stranger or hostile that does not know Minotaur (must be known, not granted by a spell). Unwelcome in most settlements.
    Languages: Speak Minotaur (no written form).



Herdborn Minotaur

The idea of the Herdborn is to represent an above-ground nomadic version of Minotaur; they're still not a common sight, as they tend to stay well clear of civilisation, but may come into contact from time to time, making them a more obvious choice for a player character.

    Alignment: Tend towards neutral, lawful if from a self-sufficient tribe, chaotic if from one that may need to raid for supplies.
    Natural Forager: Advantage of Survival when foraging.
    Tireless Traveller: Advantage on CON saves for forced marching.
    Trade Language: Speaks, reads and writes Common to a rudimentary degree (player should justify an ability to communicate and understand complex concepts in Common, and your hand-writing is probably horrific unless you have a large pen made specially).

Adds some non-combat bonuses for a flavour of Minotaur that roams plains, tundra, hills etc. Natural Forager will stack well with Outlander or Ranger for finding the huge amounts of food you need.

Labyrinthine Minotaur

This is your classic maze-dwelling monster; tend to be loners except in larger areas of the underdark where a group may control shared territory. More vicious and monstrous.

    Alignment: Tend towards evil (not above eating someone)
    Darkvision (60ft.): Easier to catch prey in your labyrinth if you can actually see.
    Labyrinthine Recall: Can perfectly recall any route you have travelled.
