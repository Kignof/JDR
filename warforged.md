Eberron - Rising from the Last War

    Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

    Age. A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum lifespan of the warforged remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.

    Alignment. Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality – or lack thereof – of the beings with which they served.

    Size. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier.
        Size modifier = 2d6
        Height = 5 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier in inches
        Weight in pounds = 270 + (4 x your size modifier)

    Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

    Constructed Resilience. You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:
        You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
        You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
        You are immune to disease.
        You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

    Sentry's Rest. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

    Integrated Protection. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor.
        You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
        You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you must remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
        While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.

    Specialized Design. You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.

    Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.

    Integrated Protection. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.
        You can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode’s prerequisite.

Integrated Protection
Mode 	Prerequisite 	Effect
  Darkwood Core (unarmored) 	None 	AC = 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor).
  Composite Plating (armored) 	Medium armor proficiency 	AC = 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus.
  Heavy Plating (armored) 	Heavy armor proficiency 	AC = 16 + your proficiency bonus; disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

    Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common.
